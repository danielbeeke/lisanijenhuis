Today I would like to talk about our experiences and what we have learned on this topic (so far).</h3><p>At most places wifi was limited and when we were at a place where we had wifi in our own bedroom that was a luxury. To me, having limited wifi was a very pleasant experience and still is. You start noticing how much time people spend staring at their phones. While you could enjoy the moment, the people surrounding you and the beauty surrounding you. Of course wifi is handy, I mean while walking through cities having a map right there on your phone is handy. And yes, I like sharing photos, I like sharing my experiences. It is a love-hate relationship, so not always being connected while traveling to me is very pleasant.</p><p>We have stayed at a place where they had compost toilets, which I mentioned before. The first two days I had to get used to it but everything gets normal. Instead of flushing you throw some earth and some straw down the hole. After our six weeks we spent at this place, I had to get used to flushing again. I mean one’s ‘normal standards’ all depend on what you are used to.</p><p>At our last place we stayed at, when we first arrived, we had no warm water, no shower, no wood stove and no windows. After about two to three weeks they got a boiler and a shower was installed as well. Tom helped out with the wood stove. The bathroom and kitchen already had a window and later the living room also got one.</p><p>Our bedroom though did not have a window, electricity was limited due to having one solar panel and this made the wifi limited as well. Plus there was no electricity in all of the bedrooms and no washing machine. Maybe to some all of this sounds like a horror story and maybe to others it does not sound like a big deal at all.</p><p>To me, no warm water, no shower, limited electricity and limited wifi those were not a big deal at all. But I did have to get used to, there being no external warmth for a period of time. All the warmth I had available was my own. And this was a bit of challenge in the beginning. You might think, how cold can it get in Spain? We were there from the end of October until the beginning of December and we had nights where the temperature dropped under zero. In the morning I had a bit of a challenge to get out of bed, where it was warm and sometimes I looked like I was ready to go skiing, the way I was dressed. But at least I was warm.</p><p>Once the wood stove was there, I had a place to go to, to get warm. This made quite a difference to me. The cold influences my mood, I function better when I am bathing in the warmth. I think I could honestly say “the warmer, the better”. I did learn though, that it’s all a mindset as well. The more you think, you are cold, the colder you’ll be. Thoughts are powerful. Extremely powerful.</p><p>Experiencing something new, new and different situations are exciting to me. How am I going to handle this? How am I going to react to this? What will I be happy with? How much do I need to be satisfied, to be happy? Those are exciting and interesting questions to me. Because the answer is up to you and only you. You can decide how you are going to handle and how you are going to react to things. You are the only one who can tell yourself now I am happy, with this and only this. And truly be happy. Satisfaction and happiness are a choice.</p><p>I had to remind myself of these things as well. At the time, when there was no wood stove, I could focus on the cold but I could also decide to focus on other things which made me extremely happy and satisfied. I was in Spain, eating organic food, working on the land, feeling free, having kind and warm-hearted people surrounding me.</p><p>I had to wash my hair by standing outside and pouring water over my head, sure no problem. Washing our clothes by hand, outside in the morning when it is 6°C outside, damn it was f*cking cold. (I have to be honest, Tom decided to take that job upon himself most of the time.) But I do find beauty in that. It is something so simple and some ‘normal luxuries’ do not always seem so normal. I never truly realized how much energy and electricity it takes to charge phones and laptops(!), to have lights on. I am grateful to have realized all those things. I am not saying those normal luxuries are a bad thing but I do think it is good to realize from time to time they are not so normal for everyone. And that you’ll be just fine without those luxuries as well.</p><p>Traveling is exciting, new experiences are exciting, life itself is exciting. It is January and really everything is possible.</p></div></main><script src=/js/scripts.cad7.js></script></body></html>
